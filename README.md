Instructions for usage:

1. Press the add button on the left and input your character's name
2. Click on the newly created tab to edit its contents
3. Click on the difficulty you will be doing. Each button under a boss corresponds to its difficulty level, going from easiest to hardest. (every additional click will correspond to an additional party member)
4. The amount of mesos and the number of crystals to be sold that week will be displayed in real time right underneath the weekly bosses title


Additional Features To Be Implemented:
1. A gear tracker to show all relevant stats on each equipment. Will make it easier to prioritize which equipment to upgrade first.
